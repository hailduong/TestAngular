# React Tutorial: Spotify

Please follow this design from Spotify, and create a React App that renders such a page 

<img src="./spotify-assignment.jpg" width="100%"/>

### Requirements:

- Render the album along with user information

**Optionals, try doing any of these if you can:**

- Clicking on any song:
    + Should show/hide the player with the selected song
    + Selected song should be green.
- Clicking on the "big green play button" below the album image, would choose the first song.
- Clicking on Prev/Next on the Player, would jump back and forth on the list.
- Clicking play would switch the "play button" to the "stop button"
and vice versa.
- There is a "check" icon next to the song name, on the player. This indicates that the song was saved to the library. 
    + Clicking on that "check" button should switch it to a "cross icon" and vice versa
    + If the song is saved, the icon in front of the music list should be a "checked" icon, instead of the "music note" icon.
- Any other idea would be good as well...
